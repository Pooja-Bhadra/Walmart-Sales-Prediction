# Walmart Sales Prediction

## Project Description

This project was done as a part of **Predictive Analytics** coursework. The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sales for Walmart stores for the following week, given the historical sales data and other relevant factors.


The project includes the following steps:

- **Data cleaning and wrangling:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the numerical features.

- **Exploratory data analysis:** Visualizing the data to identify patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable.

- **Feature engineering:** Creating new features that may improve the predictive performance of the model.

- **Model training and evaluation:** This step involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, training various machine learning models such as **Linear Refression**, **Lasso** and **Ridge Regression**, **ElasticNet Regression**, **Decision Tree** and **Random Forests** on the training data and evaluating on the test data to measure its performance.

- **Final model selection:** Based on the evaluation metrics, the best performing model is selected as the final model for predicting Walmart's sales.

The project is implemented in Python. The dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset).
